Instrumented Fork/Join implementation
--------------------------------------------------------------

This implementation is based on JSR 166 by Doug Lea. The baseline version is available either in JDK 7+,
or JSR-166 concurrency interest: http://g.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest/

QUICK START:

 1. Build the distribution
   $ mvn clean install

   This will generate target/fjp-trace.jar, which is the one and only artifact for this project.

 2. Get the trace by running your application with fjp-trace bootclasspath'ed:
   $ java -Xbootclasspath/p:fjp-trace.jar ...

   You should see something like "Using instrumented ForkJoinPool" in stdout, which will tell if bootclasspath was successful.
   Try to run your application in this mode first, this does not enable any new functionality.

 3. Enable tracing and run again
   $ java -Xbootclasspath/p:fjp-trace.jar -Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.trace=true ...

   This will generate trace dump. You can override trace dump location via -Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.traceLog=#

 4. Parse the trace:
   $ java -jar fjp-trace <trace file>

   You can also use:
     -Dwidth=#, -Dheight=# to override image size
     -Dtrace.text to override text file name
     -Dtrace.graph to override graph file name
     -Doffset=N to skip N records
     -Dlimit=M to process only M records
